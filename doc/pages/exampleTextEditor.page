This isn't a simple TextEditor, it has complex features that everyone
want in a MDI application. Mainly:

@li The <b>"Windows" menu</b> (MdiListMenu).
@li Duplication of a window: Different <b>views</b> for the same file and
    <b>enumeration of</b> those <b>views</b> (indicated with ": 1", ": 2", etc.
    in the title bar).
@li A <b>modify flag</b> (indicated with "*" in the title bar), and
    the <b>"Save changes?"</b> messages (also with support for the
    multi-views).

This example shown you how to:

@li Implement a simple Document-View design pattern (also known as
    Observer or Publish-Subscribe patterns).
@li Intensive use of SciEditor methods (also the setDocPointer
    and getDocPointer to use multiple views of the same document).
@li Usage of MdiChild, MdiClient, and MdiFrame.
@li Direct binding of MdiChild::GotFocus with SciEditor::focus() method.
@li Use SciEditor::UpdateUI.
@li Use MenuBar, Menu, and MdiListMenu.
@li Use Font and FontDialog.
@li Bind MenuItem::Action, and MenuItem::Update to update menus state.
@li Use OpenFileDialog with setMultiselect(true), and SaveFileDialog.
@li Use FindTextDialog.
@li Use ClientLayout.
