@page TN005 TN005 - Technical Note 005: MdiChild limitations when construct it

Win32 makes visible all MdiChild when they are created. There are no
way to fix this: Vaca uses @c CreateWindowEx with the @c WS_EX_MDICHILD
style, also I tried to use @c WM_MDICREATE without passing @c WS_VISIBLE
but has the same behaviour (I think that it's impossible to create a hidden
MdiChild).

Also, Windows ignores some other styles (for example: you can't
create a MdiChild without the WS_MAXIMIZEBOX style). But is possible
to change that styles after creation (using Vaca::Widget::removeStyle or
Vaca::Widget::addStyle).

Other problem is that because MdiChild is visible when it's
constructed, we lost some messages (like WM_SETFOCUS, WM_MDIACTIVATE): They
are passed directly to MdiChild::defWndProc (DefMDIChildProc finally).
So MdiChild::wndProc can't hook these events, and the onGotFocus() and
onActivate() events aren't generated.

To fix this, we repost various messages to the message queue using
Win32 PostMessage():
@li @c WM_SETFOCUS to generate Widget::onGotFocus.
@li @c WM_MDIACTIVATE to generate Frame::onActivate.
@li @c WM_SIZE to generate Frame::onResize (and layout children).
