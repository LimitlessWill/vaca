@page TN008 TN008 - Technical Note 008: Unicode support

Vaca can be compiled with Unicode support without problems for
W2K/WinXP. If you want to add Unicode support for Win95/98/Me, you
will need the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU).

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm</a>

To avoid the MSLU, don't compile Vaca with Unicode support when you
want to use your application on Win95/98/Me.

<h2>Why the Edit widget doesn't support Unicode character even when I
compiled Vaca with Unicode support?</h2>

The Vaca's Edit widget is Win32's EDIT control, and it doesn't support
Unicode characters. The same happen for ComboBoxes because they use
Edit control too.

The solution is to use a RichEdit widget in replacement of Edit.
