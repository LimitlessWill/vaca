@section page_intro_whatis What is Vaca?

Vaca is a library to wrap the Win32 API with C++ classes. It's has
some extra functionalities like dockable tool bars and layout
managers. This library uses templates and STL (but not generic
programming).

First versions of Vaca depend of <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a>
libraries. Right now Vaca doesn't need Boost anymore.


@section page_intro_objetives Objetives

@li Fit design to make programming more easy.
@li Constructors initialize resources. If I do @c "new MyWindow()", then my window should be created (see @ref page_tn_002).
@li Documentation for every tricky situation, its solution, and examples.
@li Technical Notes about how more common (or uncommon) problems were solved.


@section page_intro_alternatives Alternatives

There are a lot of better alternatives to use instead of Vaca. If you
have to build a serious project, I recommend you to use
<a href="http://www.wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>, but
there are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_widget_toolkits">other
good choices</a>.
