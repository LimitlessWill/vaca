@page api API

In this page I'll give some kind of explanation about the names of
methods and classes:

- <b>@c Rect or @c Rectangle?</b> Rect is shorter. Also, we can use
  @c drawRect and @c fillRect instead of drawRectangle. It's commondly
  used in the Win32 API (as @c RECT) and in the MFC like @c CRect.

- <b>Why not @c getClientRect or @c getRect?</b> @c getClientBounds
  and @c getBounds are the Java convention, they are better because
  they indicate what them return (@em bounds of the widget), not the
  type of return (a @em Rect).

- <b>Why @c getR, @c getG, and @c getB in @c Color class?</b> Because:
  - They are shorter than @c getRed, @c getGreen, and @c getBlue.
  - RGB expression is very common.
  - @c getRed sounds like we will obtain the red color, and not the red component
    of the color (the real name for the method should be @c getRedComponent or
    @c getRedChannelValue).
  - Also, a method @c Color::green() is not good because they don't
    give us a verb (like @a get or @a set).
