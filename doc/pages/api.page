@page api API

In this page I'll give some kind of explanation about the names of
methods and classes:

- <b>@c Rect or @c Rectangle?</b> Rect is shorter. Also, we can use
  @c drawRect and @c fillRect instead of drawRectangle. It's commondly
  used in the Win32 API (as @c RECT) and in the MFC like @c CRect.

- <b>Why not @c getClientRect or @c getRect?</b> @c getClientBounds
  and @c getBounds are the Java convention, they are better because
  indicates what return (the @em bounds of the widget), not the type
  of return (a @em Rect).

- <b>Why @c getR, @c getG, and @c getB in @c Color class?</b> Because
  they are shorter than @c getRed, @c getGreen, and @c getBlue. Also,
  a method @c Color::green() is not good because they don't give us
  a verb (like @a get or @a set).
