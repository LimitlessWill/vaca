@page TN006 TN006 - Technical Note 006: Deleting a Widget inside its event

There are a big problem with signals: <b>YOU CAN'T DELETE A WIDGET
INSIDE AN EVENT WHICH THE WIDGET BY ITSELF GENERATED</b>. The solution
is quite simple: Use the @ref Vaca::Widget#deleteAfterEvent "Widget::deleteAfterEvent"
method.

See the TextEditor example, it uses the @c deleteAfterEvent to
delete an MdiChild when its close button is pushed by the user.

@see Vaca::Frame::onClose
