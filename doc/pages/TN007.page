@page TN007 TN007 - Technical Note 007: Calling CreateWindowEx without text

The @c CreateWindowEx called from @c Widget::createHwnd specifies an empty
text for the window. In general, properties that can be changed later,
should be avoided to use in the @c createHwnd. It was designed in this
way mainly to have @em only the necessary arguments in the createHwnd.

This has a little implication for @c MdiChild::MdiChild().  Let me
explain you. When you create a @c MdiChild, the @c MdiListMenu must be
updated (we need to add the title of that @c MdiChild in the list),
this is done automatically by Windows with the text specified in the
@c CreateWindowEx. But because Vaca doesn't specify text in the
@c CreateWindowEx (the Frame::Frame() does the Widget::setText),
the constructor of @c MdiChild sends a WM_MDIREFRESHMENU to its
parent (an @c MdiClient) to update the @c MdiListMenu.

@see Vaca::Widget::createHwnd,
     Vaca::Widget::MdiChild::MdiChild,
     Vaca::Widget::MdiListMenu

<h2>Why are styles specified in createHwnd if them can be changed later?</h2>

That is not true, there are some styles that MUST be specified
in the creation of the HWND and can't be changed latter. For example:
@c ES_LEFT, @c ES_CENTER and ES_RIGHT.
