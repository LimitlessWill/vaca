Important note about static version
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When compile the static version of the library, remember to use the
-DVACA_STATIC=1 flag in your compiler to avoid using the DLL imports
routines.


How to compile Vaca manually?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

(Imagining that you decompressed the Vaca.zip in the "Vaca/" directory)

To compile the source code with your compiler you should:
* First of all compile boost 1.33.1 (this is the hard part :)
* After that, you have to compile the Vaca sources using some
  special flags:
  - because Vaca uses dynamic_cast, compile using Run-Time Type
    information, there are some compilers that doesn't need flags
    by default (like GCC), but Visual C++ needs the /GR flag;
  - make the boost root directory as a include-path (e.g. -Ic:/boost_1_33_1),
    to access the <boost/*.hpp> files;
  - put the "Vaca/include/" directory in the include-paths list, to access
    the "Vaca/*.h" files;
  - put the "Vaca/" directory in the include-paths list, to access "stdvaca.h";
  - you must to define some constants:
    * -DVACA_SRC (the most important one, all the source code of Vaca
      library must be compiled using this flag, the examples and
      applications must be compiled without this flag)
    * -DVACA_STATIC when you don't want to use the DLL, and you just want to
      to use the static library
    * -DWINVER=0x0500
    * -D_WIN32_IE=0x0500
    * -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0500
    * -DUNICODE and -D_UNICODE to add Unicode support
    * -D_DEBUG when you want debug information
    * -DNDEBUG when you don't want debug information
  - finally compile all the *.cpp using that flags and put all the
    objects files (.o .obj) in a library file (.lib .a).


Visual C++ 7.1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have boost 1.33.1 installed in c:/boost_1_33_1, you don't need
to modify anything. If not, you need to modify the paths (for the
includes and the libs). Also, don't try to compile the shared version,
it'll fail. You should be able to compile the static version only.


MinGW
----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile Vaca you need Boost library, please, modify the Makefile to
your requirements:

  BOOSTDIR = c:/boost_1_33_1
  BOOSTLIBS = ...

  (you can use an enviroment variable for BOOSTDIR)

In the future will be a better solution (maybe a Jamfile)

You can use:

  make [DEBUG=1] [STATIC=1] [PROFILE=1] [UNICODE=1]

To compile a specific variant of Vaca library.


Scintilla
----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are compiling the source code, remember to put the SciLexer.dll
in the bin directory.

You will need to decompress the Scintilla zip (scintilla167.zip) in
the vaca root directory. You should have a directory structure like:

   Vaca/
     bin/
     scintilla/
       bin/
       include/
       ...

Compile Scintilla and move the libraries (SciLexer.dll)
from "Vaca/scintilla/bin" to "Vaca/bin".
